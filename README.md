### _FPGA Acceleration Homework_
> As a sceptical engineer you are not sure about what the professor told you about the runtime efficiency of FPGAs. We have CPUs and GPUs anyway. Why the hell should we use FPGAs now?
But you are still curious and/or you need a grade to pass this course, you want to test using your own application whether what the professor told you makes sense.
You love cats. Everyone loves cats! So you think that some cats would brighten up your mood but also others’.You decide to create a notebook which:
▶ downloads many cat photos of the same same from the internet, e.g.,10s to 100s)
▶ creates thumbnails of these photos, e.g., 64x64 px
You want to compare the runtime of software and hardware thumbnailer using the resizer overlay from the PYNQ Hello-World example. Optionally create a collage of the downloaded photos.

Image re-sizer that uses PL and PS to compress cats images, what actualy happens it takes the number of images being added and resize them to the needed size and collapse them into output.
